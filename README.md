# Head-Pose-Estimation-Using-2D-Points
This project works on estimating the head pose from pictures of videos using 2D points (x & y) to predict the pitch, yaw, and roll moments.
# Dataset
The model was trained on AFLW2000-3D that can be found on this link: http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/xiangyuzhu/projects/3DDFA/Database/AFLW2000-3D.zip
